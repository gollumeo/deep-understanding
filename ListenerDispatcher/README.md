# Module: ListenerDispatcher

## Purpose
Build a minimal listener dispatcher that can resolve and invoke listeners attached to events. This module complements the EventBus.

## Target Features (MVP)
- Receive a list of listeners
- Call each with the corresponding event
- Handle both callable arrays and invokable classes

## Technical Constraints
- PHP only
- Interfaces for dispatcher and listener
- TDD only

## Why this module?
To understand:
- Listener resolution and type normalization
- Invocation patterns (invoke, method call, etc.)
- Chaining and control flow for event consumption

## Potential Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Return aggregation
- Exception management strategies
- Logging integration

## Status
> Planned
