# Module: Stream

## Purpose

Understand and implement the core principles of streaming data in a backend environment.  
The goal is to design a system capable of delivering partial results progressively (chunk by chunk), while supporting
interruptions, reconnections, and multi-client consumption â€” without relying on any transport-specific protocol like SSE
or WebSocket.

## Target Features (MVP)

- Create a stream session with unique ID
- Push data incrementally (chunk by chunk)
- Retrieve all current chunks from a given stream
- Support client reconnection to an ongoing stream
- Mark stream as complete or failed
- TTL-based expiration of inactive sessions

## Technical Constraints

- No external libraries or frameworks
- In-memory only (no Redis/Kafka for MVP)
- Stateless transport abstraction (no SSE/WebSocket coupling)
- Focused on logic, not protocol
- TDD only

## Why this module?

To deeply understand:

- What a stream really is (beyond collection methods)
- How to manage progressive data flow under uncertainty
- How to model stream state transitions cleanly (start, pause, resume, complete)
- How to handle multiple clients on a single stream
- How to decouple stream logic from underlying transport

## Potential Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Add pluggable backends (Redis, file, DB)
- Support for stream replay from given offset
- Integrate with EventBus for stream lifecycle events
- Add publish-subscribe mechanism (Observer pattern)
- Simulate gRPC/SSE/WebSocket integration via test adapters
