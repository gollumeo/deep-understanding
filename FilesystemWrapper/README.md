# Module: FilesystemWrapper

## Purpose
Abstract basic file operations (read, write, delete) behind a dedicated interface. Avoid direct use of native `file_put_contents`, etc.

## Target Features (MVP)
- Read/write/delete files
- Directory creation
- Check existence

## Technical Constraints
- No use of Laravel filesystem
- Interface-driven
- Error-safe by design
- TDD

## Why this module?
To understand:
- Decoupling infrastructure (I/O)
- Testable file operations
- System-level error handling

## Potential Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Stream support
- Mock filesystem (for tests)
- Adapters for S3, etc. (mocked)

## Status
> Planned
