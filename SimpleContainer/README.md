# Module: SimpleContainer

## Purpose
Build a very basic service container to register and resolve dependencies manually. No auto-wiring, just fundamentals.

## Target Features (MVP)
- Bind interfaces to concrete classes
- Support singleton/shared instances
- Resolve via container

## Technical Constraints
- PHP only
- No auto-wiring
- TDD-only

## Why this module?
To understand:
- Dependency Injection manually
- Binding resolution
- Scope control (singleton vs factory)

## Potential Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Contextual bindings
- Lazy loading
- Auto-wiring (optional)

## Status
> Planned
